# Devise Security

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/devise-security/devise-security.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/devise-security/devise-security)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/devise-security/devise-security/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/devise-security/devise-security?branch=master)[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/ace7cd003a0db8bffa5a/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/devise-security/devise-security/maintainability)

A [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) extension to add additional security features required by modern web applications. Forked from [Devise Security Extension](https://github.com/phatworx/devise_security_extension)

It is composed of 7 additional Devise modules:

- `:password_expirable` - passwords will expire after a configured time (and will need to be changed by the user). You will most likely want to use `:password_expirable` together with the `:password_archivable` module to [prevent the current expired password being reused](https://github.com/phatworx/devise_security_extension/issues/175) immediately as the new password.
- `:secure_validatable` - better way to validate a model (email, stronger password validation). Don't use with Devise `:validatable` module!
- `:password_archivable` - save used passwords in an `old_passwords` table for history checks (don't be able to use a formerly used password)
- `:session_limitable` - ensures, that there is only one session usable per account at once
- `:expirable` - expires a user account after x days of inactivity (default 90 days)
- `:security_questionable` - as accessible substitution for captchas (security question with captcha fallback)
- `:paranoid_verification` - admin can generate verification code that user needs to fill in otherwise he wont be able to use the application.

Configuration and database schema for each module below.

## Additional features

- **captcha support** for `sign_up`, `sign_in`, `recover` and `unlock` (to make automated mass creation and brute forcing of accounts harder)

## Getting started

Devise Security works with Devise on Rails 4.2 onwards. You can add it to your Gemfile after you successfully set up Devise (see [Devise documentation](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)) with:

```ruby
gem 'devise-security'
```

Run the bundle command to install it.

After you installed Devise Security you need to run the generator:

```console
rails generate devise_security:install
```

The generator adds optional configurations to `config/initializers/devise-security.rb`. Enable the modules you wish to use in the initializer you are ready to add Devise Security modules on top of Devise modules to any of your Devise models:

```ruby
devise :password_expirable, :secure_validatable, :password_archivable, :session_limitable, :expirable
```

### E-mail Validation

for `:secure_validatable` you need to have a way to validate an e-mail. There are multiple libraries that support this, and even a way built into Ruby!

[Ruby Constant](http://yogodoshi.com/ruby-already-has-its-own-regular-expression-to-validate-emails/)
  * Note: This method would require a `email_validation` method to be defined in order to hook into the `validates` method defined here.
[email_address](https://github.com/afair/email_address) gem
[valid_email2](https://github.com/micke/valid_email2) gem
[rails_email_validator](https://github.com/phatworx/rails_email_validator) gem (deprecated)

## Configuration

```ruby
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ==> Security Extension
  # Configure security extension for devise

  # Password expires after a configurable time (in seconds).
  # Or expire passwords on demand by setting this configuration to `true`
  # Use `user.need_password_change!` to expire a password.
  # Setting the configuration to `false` will completely disable expiration checks.
  # config.expire_password_after = 3.months | true | false

  # Need 1 char each of: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and a punctuation mark or symbol
  # config.password_complexity = { digit: 1, lower: 1, symbol: 1, upper: 1 }

  # Number of old passwords in archive
  # config.password_archiving_count = 5

  # Deny old password (true, false, count)
  # config.deny_old_passwords = true

  # captcha integration for recover form
  # config.captcha_for_recover = true

  # captcha integration for sign up form
  # config.captcha_for_sign_up = true

  # captcha integration for sign in form
  # config.captcha_for_sign_in = true

  # captcha integration for unlock form
  # config.captcha_for_unlock = true

  # security_question integration for recover form
  # this automatically enables captchas (captcha_for_recover, as fallback)
  # config.security_question_for_recover = false

  # security_question integration for unlock form
  # this automatically enables captchas (captcha_for_unlock, as fallback)
  # config.security_question_for_unlock = false

  # security_question integration for confirmation form
  # this automatically enables captchas (captcha_for_confirmation, as fallback)
  # config.security_question_for_confirmation = false

  # ==> Configuration for :expirable
  # Time period for account expiry from last_activity_at
  # config.expire_after = 90.days
end
```

## Other ORMs

Devise-security supports [Mongoid](https://rubygems.org/gems/mongoid) as an alternative ORM to active_record.  To use this ORM, add this to your `Gemfile`.

    gem 'mongoid'

And then ensure that the environment variable `DEVISE_ORM=mongoid` is set.

For local development you will need to have MongoDB installed locally.

    brew install mongodb

### Rails App setup example with Mongoid

```ruby
# inside config/application.rb
require File.expand_path('../boot', __FILE__)
#...
DEVISE_ORM=:mongoid

# Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems
# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.
Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    #...
  end
end  
```

## Captcha-Support

The captcha support depends on [EasyCaptcha](https://github.com/phatworx/easy_captcha). See further documentation there.

### Installation

1. Add EasyCaptcha to your `Gemfile` with

```ruby
gem 'easy_captcha'
```

1. Run the initializer

```ruby
rails generate easy_captcha:install
```

1. Enable captcha - see "Configuration" of Devise Security above.
1. Add the captcha in the generated devise views for each controller you have activated

```erb
<p><%= captcha_tag %></p>
<p><%= text_field_tag :captcha %></p>
```

## Schema

### Password expirable

```ruby
create_table :the_resources do |t|
  # other devise fields

  t.datetime :password_changed_at
end
add_index :the_resources, :password_changed_at
```

Note: setting `password_changed_at` to `nil` will require the user to change their password.

### Password archivable

```ruby
create_table :old_passwords do |t|
  t.string :encrypted_password, null: false
  t.string :password_archivable_type, null: false
  t.integer :password_archivable_id, null: false
  t.string :password_salt # Optional. bcrypt stores the salt in the encrypted password field so this column may not be necessary.
  t.datetime :created_at
end
add_index :old_passwords, [:password_archivable_type, :password_archivable_id], name: :index_password_archivable
```

### Session limitable

```ruby
create_table :the_resources do |t|
  # other devise fields

  t.string :unique_session_id, limit: 20
end
```

### Expirable

```ruby
create_table :the_resources do |t|
  # other devise fields

  t.datetime :last_activity_at
  t.datetime :expired_at
end
add_index :the_resources, :last_activity_at
add_index :the_resources, :expired_at
```

### Paranoid verifiable

```ruby
create_table :the_resources do |t|
  # other devise fields

  t.string   :paranoid_verification_code
  t.integer  :paranoid_verification_attempt, default: 0
  t.datetime :paranoid_verified_at
end
add_index :the_resources, :paranoid_verification_code
add_index :the_resources, :paranoid_verified_at
```

[Documentation for Paranoid Verifiable module](https://github.com/devise-security/devise-security/wiki/Paranoid-Verification)

### Security questionable

```ruby
# app/models/security_question.rb
class SecurityQuestion < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :locale, presence: true
  validates :name, presence: true, uniqueness: true
end
```

```ruby
create_table :security_questions do |t|
  t.string :locale, null: false
  t.string :name, null: false
end

SecurityQuestion.create! locale: :de, name: 'Wie lautet der Geburstname Ihrer Mutter?'
SecurityQuestion.create! locale: :de, name: 'Wo sind sie geboren?'
SecurityQuestion.create! locale: :de, name: 'Wie lautet der Name Ihres ersten Haustieres?'
SecurityQuestion.create! locale: :de, name: 'Was ist Ihr Lieblingsfilm?'
SecurityQuestion.create! locale: :de, name: 'Was ist Ihr Lieblingsbuch?'
SecurityQuestion.create! locale: :de, name: 'Was ist Ihr Lieblingstier?'
SecurityQuestion.create! locale: :de, name: 'Was ist Ihr Lieblings-Reiseland?'
```

```ruby
add_column :the_resources, :security_question_id, :integer
add_column :the_resources, :security_question_answer, :string
```

or

```ruby
create_table :the_resources do |t|
  # other devise fields

  t.integer :security_question_id
  t.string :security_question_answer
end
```

## Contributing to devise-security

- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
- Fork the project
- Start a feature/bugfix branch
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

## Running tests

Standard tests can be invoked using `rake`.  To run the tests against the `mongoid` ORM, use `DEVISE_ORM=mongoid rake` while `mongodb` is running.

To locally simulate what travis-ci will run when you push code use:

    $ wwtd
